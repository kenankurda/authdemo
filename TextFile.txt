First step-
Change Connection string of this app to point to the db of the App that was newly created 

Adapt the changes in the newly created app in Startup.cs and add folliwing to the newly created app just after the DbContext

 services.AddIdentity<IdentityUser, IdentityRole>(options => options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = false)
                .AddDefaultUI()
                .AddDefaultTokenProviders()
                .AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>();

                in newly created app add folowing to be tested on controller level or Action Level:

                 [Authorize(Roles = "PowerUser")] 
                 [Authorize(Roles = "Administrator")]
